- **Additional Functions**:
  - **C**: Clears the display.
  - **±**: Changes the sign of the displayed number.
  - **√**: Calculates the square root of the displayed number.

## Installation

### 1. Install Python

If you don't have Python installed, download and install the latest version from the official website:

- [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Follow the installation instructions based on your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux).

### 2. Install `tkinter`

`tkinter` is the standard Python interface for GUI (Graphical User Interface) programming. It usually comes pre-installed with Python, but if it's missing or needs to be installed manually, follow these steps:

#### For Windows:
`tkinter` should already be included with your Python installation. If not, you can reinstall Python and make sure to check the box to install `tkinter` during the setup.

#### For macOS:
`tkinter` may not be installed by default. To install it, you can use the following command (if you are using Homebrew for package management):
```bash
brew install python-tk
```

For Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
On Linux, you can install tkinter using your package manager:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

3. Clone the Repository (Optional)
If you want to clone the project to your local machine, use the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/graphical-calculator-python
```
```bash
cd graphical-calculator-python
```
Alternatively, you can simply copy the code into a file called calculator.py on your machine.

4. Run the Calculator
Once Python and tkinter are installed, you can run the calculator by executing the following command:

```bash
python calculator.py
```
This will open a graphical window where you can perform calculations.
